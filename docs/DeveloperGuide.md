## Design

This section outlines the various components of the application and explains
how they interact to execute the program.

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./Images/architecture.png)

The Architecture Diagram above explains the high-level design of the application

* **Main**: Control the main flow of the application from launch to shut down.
* **Parser**: Parse user input to command that application can execute
* **Ui**: Read user input, display output of user commands, errors and instructions
* **Command**: Executable commands of the application.
* **Storage**: Storing data and settings in hard disk and loading them during the run of application.
* **Manager**: Holds the data while the application is running

### Main
Main will handle the setup and loop to execute the interaction with user

Here are the sequence diagram shows the important features:

![sequence diagram](./Images/mianseq.png)

### Storage
Storage will storage all the data in `.txt` and `.csv` file.
Storage will parse the local string data into executable objects.

### UI
The `UI` component contain Ui classes, it will display all message that will be seen by user.
It will also print out errors.

![class](./Images/uiClass.png)
![sequence diagram](./Images/ui.png)

* `readCommand()`: UI works as it takes input from `scanner` and then return it to `parser` as read command
* UI will print output when the command is executed.

Here are an example when UI handle user commands:
![example](./Images/uiSearch.png)

`UI` Takes in User input and pass it to `Parser`. `Parser` parse input into a command and execute that command, and pass the output value to `UI`. Then `UI`
display that output to the User.  
In this case, User type in `search` command. `UI` read that command and pass it to `Parser` to parse and handle it.
`Parser` parse it as a `search` command and execute it by searching in `Manager` component. `Manager` component return the output to `UI` and `UI` display it for Users,

### Parser
The `Parser` component is `Parser` Class. It handles the input `UI` read.

As the example shows in `UI` segment, `Parser` parse and execute the user input.

![parser](./Images/parser.png)

`Parser` parse input to command and pass it to `Command` to handle

When `Parser` get invalid input, it will throw exceptions and let `UI` print the error directly.

![parse error](./Images/parserError.png)

### Command
`Command` component contains lots of command class, they were called when `Parser` receive valid command and execute the following code

![command](./Images/Command.png)

`Command` class contain two main method, and all other `command` component will extend from this class.
`Command` will execute code inside `execute()` method, such as `deleteCommand` will delete `transactions` in `execute`.

### Manager
`Manager` component is used for managing data while the application is running.
They store data in memory.
So `Manager` should contain methods to operate data such as `add` `delete`.
`Manager` would not save data to local, but `Storage` will store them automatically.

## Implementation

### Transaction Basic Data Structure

![Class Diagram](./Images/class.png)

**Feature Description:**  
The `Transaction` class serves as the fundamental data structure for managing financial transactions in our application. It encapsulates essential information about each transaction, providing a structured way to store and manipulate transaction data. The class includes the following fields:

- `id` (Transaction ID)
- `description` (Transaction description)
- `amount` (Transaction amount)
- `currency` (Currency type)
- `category` (Transaction category)
- `date` (Transaction date)
- `status` (Transaction status)

added the ability to set the period at which expenses recur, stored in the `recurringPeriod` field.

Additionally, the Transaction class provides a field to mark whether a transaction has been deleted (isDeleted), which allows the application to logically delete a transaction while preserving data integrity.

`Currency`, `Category`, `Priority` and `Status` are `enum`.

### Managing Transactions with TransactionManager

The `TransactionManager` class plays a central role in managing the collection of Transaction objects. It functions as a memory-based manager, providing methods for adding, deleting, and updating transactions. The class operates using an ArrayList<Transaction>, which is used to store all active transactions.

Key functionalities in the TransactionManager class include:

* `addTransaction():` This method allows the addition of new transactions to the list. If the transaction is recurring, the recurringPeriod is set to the specified value, and the transaction is added to the memory list. It also ensures that the transaction ID is unique, incrementing the ID counter if necessary.
* `getTransactions():` This method returns a list of all non-deleted transactions. It filters out deleted transactions and sorts the remaining transactions based on their date to maintain chronological order.
* `deleteTransaction(int id):` Marks a transaction as deleted, ensuring it is excluded from future operations without physically removing it from the storage. This method prevents accidental deletion of data and maintains data consistency.
* `getTotalTransactionAmount():` This method calculates the total amount of all non-deleted transactions, helping users track their total spending and income.
* `getRecurringTransactions():` This method returns a list of recurring transactions that are scheduled to occur in the future. It allows for managing subscriptions, rent payments, and other periodic expenses.

**Implementation Consideration:**  
The Transaction class and the TransactionManager class work together to form a powerful, flexible solution for managing financial transactions in a budgeting application. Here are the key considerations:
* **Data Integrity:** Using isDeleted flags instead of removing transactions helps maintain historical data, which is important for audit purposes and for users who might want to review or restore previous transactions.
* **Recurrence Support:** The addition of the recurringPeriod field allows for the management of recurring transactions. This feature is particularly useful for users who need to track regular payments like subscriptions, rent, or salaries.
* **Currency and Category:** Standardization: The use of Currency and Category enums ensures that all transaction entries are consistent and categorized appropriately. This makes it easier to filter, report, and analyze transactions by type or currency.
* **Memory Management:** The ArrayList is chosen as the underlying data structure for its simplicity and efficiency in managing dynamic data sets. However, as the number of transactions grows, the application may need to transition to more advanced storage solutions, such as databases, to handle larger data sets efficiently.
* **Budget Management:** The TransactionManager class allows for budget constraints to be set, which is essential for managing user expenses. The system warns users when they are nearing or exceeding their budget, helping users keep track of their financial limits.

### Transaction Management Features: Tick, Add, Exit, List

![Tick](./Images/tick.png)
![Untick](./Images/untick.png)
![add](./Images/AddDiagram.png)
![list](./Images/list.png)

**Feature Description:**  

* Mark Transaction: Allows users to mark a transaction with a specific status (Completed or Pending).
* Add Transaction: Users can add a new transaction with description, amount, category, and other attributes.
* List Transaction: User can list all the transactions in the manager.
* Exit Program: Exits the program and ensures any unsaved transactions are stored.


**Design Consideration:**  
These functionalities allow the program to provide basic transaction management capabilities. <br>
Searching and adding transactions is streamlined for ease of use, and the exit process is handled to ensure data
persistence.

---

### Transaction Management Features: Delete, Set Budget Limit, Notifications and Summary

##### Deletion
![DeleteCommand](Images/DeleteCommand.png)

#### Set Budget
![SetBudget](Images/SetBudget.png)

#### Notification 
![NotifyCommand](Images/NotifyCommand.png)

#### Summary 
![Summary](Images/Summary.png)

**Feature Description:**
* Delete Transaction (delete): Lets users remove unwanted or erroneous transaction entries using their index in the displayed list.
* Set Budget Limit (setBudget): Enables users to define a spending cap to avoid overspending. Once the total recorded expenses exceed this limit, a warning is displayed to alert the user.
* Set Notifications for Upcoming Payments (notify): Allows users to schedule reminders for future expenses based on the transaction's description, amount, category, and due date.
* Summary of Expenses (summary): Provides an overview of expenses for a specified time frame, enabling quick and effective financial review.

**Design Consideration:**  

The `deletion`, `budget limit` and `notification` features are designed to improve financial awareness and discipline.
Users can monitor their spending relative to a predefined threshold and receive timely reminders for future payments.

Expense summaries provide users with quick, insightful overviews of their spending patterns within a selected time frame, enhancing their ability to review and adjust financial behavior promptly.

These capabilities integrate seamlessly with the transaction management system, enhancing the user experience through automation
and clear visual cues for overspending or pending transactions.

### Transaction Management Features: Alert, Set Priority and Convert Currency function 

##### Alert Operation  
![Alert Command](Images/AlertCommand.png)

##### Set Priority  
![Set Priority](Images/SetPriority.png)

##### Convert Currency
![Convert Currency](Images/Convert.png)

**Feature Description:**
* Set Priority (priority): Allows users to assign a priority level (low, medium, or high) to a transaction. By default, all expenses are low priority. This helps users focus on the most urgent or important expenses.

* View Spending Alerts (alert): Displays an overview of upcoming expenses, recurring payments, current remaining budget, and whether the spending has exceeded the set budget limit. This command combines notification, priority, and budget insights in a single view.

* Convert Currency (convert): Allows users to convert the amount of a transaction from its original currency to a specified target currency. This is particularly useful for users tracking multi-currency expenses or international purchases.

**Design Consideration:**

Priority levels help users organize and focus on transactions based on importance or urgency.

Spending alerts consolidate relevant financial insights—notifications, recurring transactions, and budget status—into 
one unified interface for quick decision-making.

The convert feature adds a layer of flexibility for users dealing with multiple currencies. It simplifies financial tracking by converting values into a uniform currency for easier comparison and understanding. It is designed with immediate feedback through the UI to help users understand how currency changes affect their recorded transactions. 
The conversion is performed using the transaction's stored data and is integrated directly into the TransactionManager, ensuring that currency changes do not interfere with other transaction attributes or analytical features.

---

### Transaction Management Features: Set Recurring Period, Search, and Edit

`Zhu Yangyi` added the following functionalities to manage transactions:

* Set Recurring Period: Allows users to set transactions to recur every `recurringPeriod` days. <br>
![Set Recur Sequence Diagram](./Images/setRecur.png)
* Search Transaction: Allows users to search through list of transactions by either description (default) or id.
* Edit Transaction: Allows users to edit the description, category, amount, or currency of a transaction.

```java
public void setRecurringPeriod(int recurringPeriod) {
    this.recurringPeriod = recurringPeriod;
}

public ArrayList<Transaction> searchTransactionList(boolean isIndex, String searchTerm, Ui ui) {
    try {
        ArrayList<Transaction> printTransactions = new ArrayList<>();
        if (isIndex) {
            // Searches for transaction with given index and adds to printTransactions
        } else {
            // Searches for all transactions whose description contain the search term and adds to printTransactions
        }
        return printTransactions;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Error handling
    }
}

public void editInfo(int id, String info, int type) {
    if (checkIdEmpty(id)) {
    }
    
    // switch-case to update transaction
}
```

**Design Consideration:**  
The ability to set recurring period allows users to manage subscriptions or bills without having to add them
repeatedly. <br>
`searchTransactionList(boolean, String, Ui)` and `editInfo(int, T)` enable users to browse and make changes to their log
with ease.

---

### Transaction Management Features: Filter by date, Currency Conversion, Sort by date

`Faheem Akram` added the following functionalities to manage transactions:

* Upcoming Transactions (`getUpcomingTransactions`): Allows users to get transactions for an upcoming date
* Convert Currency (`convertTo`): Allows users to change from one currency to another

```Java
public ArrayList<Transaction> sortTransactions(ArrayList<Transaction> transactions) {

        transactions.sort((t1, t2) -> {
            if (t1.getDate() == null && t2.getDate() == null) {
                return 0;
            }
            if (t1.getDate() == null) {
                return -1;
            }
            if (t2.getDate() == null) {
                return 1;
            }
            return t1.getDate().compareTo(t2.getDate());
        });

        return transactions;
    }

public void getUpcomingTransactions(String period) {

    period = period.toLowerCase();
    switch (period) {
        case "today":
            System.out.println(getTransactionsOnDate(LocalDate.now()));
        case "week":
            System.out.println(getTransactionsThisWeek());
        case "month":
            System.out.println(getTransactionsThisMonth());
        default:
            try {
                LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(period);
                System.out.println(getTransactionsOnDate(date));
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Invalid period. Use 'today', 'week', 'month', or a date (yyyy-mm-dd)");
            }
    }
}
```

**Design Consideration:**
The ability to sort by and filter by date allows for the user to quickly find what the soonest transactions will be
so that they can plan accordingly.

---


### Transaction Management Features: Currency Conversion

`Faheem Akram` added the following feature:

* Sort by date (`sortTransactions`): Sorts transactions by date

```Java
public void convertTo(Currency currency) {
double toSGD = 1/this.currency.getRate();
this.amount = currency.getRate() * toSGD;
this.currency = currency;
}
```

**Design Consideration:**

This allows for users to effectively convert between different common currencies.

---

### Goal:

### Financial Goal Basic Data Structure

![Goal Class Diagram](./Images/GoalDiagram.png)

`Faheem Akram` implemented the `FinancialGoal` class with data structure and methods for financial goals. It includes the following fields:

- `currentGoal` (Goal name)
- `targetAmount` (Goal target)
- `description` (Goal description)
- `isAchieved` (Goal achieved status)
- `currency` (Goal currency type)
- `currentAmount` (Transaction date)
- `status` (Transaction status) <br>

`Zhu Yangyi` added the `expenses` field which stores the total amount paid, in order to synchronize expenditure with savings.
  
```Java
  public class FinancialGoal {

  private String currentGoal;
  private double targetAmount;
  private String description;
  private Currency currency;

  // Changeable fields

  private boolean isAchieved;
  private double currentAmount;
  private boolean isBlank;
  private int expenses;
  }
```

`Zhu Yangyi` integrated the `Goal` class into the program through the `Parser` class.

```java
public static void parseGoalCommands(String command, Ui ui, FinancialGoal goal) throws Exception {
    switch (command) {
    case GOAL_TARGET:
        // Command to update target
    case GOAL_DESC:
        // Command to update description
    case GOAL_TITLE:
        // Command to update title
    case GOAL_STATUS:
        // Command to view status
    case GOAL_NEW:
        // Command to create a new goal
    default:
        // View goal (default) / create new goal (if empty)
    }
}
```

**Design Consideration:**  
This implementation allows users to update individual parts of the goal, allowing for a more modular approach when only minor modifications are required to having to set a new goal each time.

---

### Goal Management Features: Create and Check

Feature Description:  
`Faheem Akram` added 2 main functions to Create goals and check them
* Create goal (`createNewGoal`): Lets users create a new goal by prompting them for each field required.
* Check Goal (`checkGoalStatus`):

```Java
public FinancialGoal createNewGoal() {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int amount;
Ui.createGoalConfirm();

    if (!sc.nextLine().equals("Y")) {
        Ui.createGoalAborted();
        return this;
    }
    Ui.createGoalName();
    setGoal(sc.nextLine());
    Ui.createGoalTarget();
    amount = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
    setTargetAmount(amount);
    Ui.createGoalDescription();
    setDescription(sc.nextLine());
    Ui.createGoalSuccess();
    return this;
}
```

---

### Goal Status Check: Integration with Transactions to Reflect Balance

`Zhu Yangyi` integrated expenses with deposits made to calculate balance to better reflect progress made towards the set goal. `goal.updateExpenses(transactions);` is run each time a goal command is sent to ensure that the progress shown is accurate.
<br> <br>
The total expenditure is calculated through adding `getRecurringAmount()` and `getNormalAmount`.

```java
public int getRecurringAmount() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (Transaction transaction : transactions) {
        if (transaction.getRecurringPeriod() > 0 && !transaction.isDeleted()) {
            long daysBetween = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(transaction.getDate(), LocalDate.now());
            sum += transaction.getAmount() * (int)((double) daysBetween / transaction.getRecurringPeriod() + 1);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

public int getNormalAmount() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (Transaction transaction : transactions) {
        if (transaction.getRecurringPeriod() <= 0 && !transaction.isDeleted() && transaction.isCompleted()) {
            sum += transaction.getAmount();
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Design Consideration:**  
`getRecurringAmount` returns the sum of all past cycles of the transaction up until the current date. <br>
`getNormalAmount` returns all completed one-time transactions. <br>
Both ignore deleted records. 
<br> <br>
The total expenditure is calculated before `goal` commands are executed instead of every time `transactions` is updated. This saves both time in processing and lines of code as this implementation only requires a singular instance of this command being called each time the user wishes to check their progress.
